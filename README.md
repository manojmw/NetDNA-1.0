# NetDNA-1.0
This is a basic python script for the web-based tool (I call it NetDNA-1.0). It can easily run on Streamlit, and generates basic biological data from the query DNA sequence.<br/><br/>

## Following details are obtained from the query DNA sequence:
 - Length of the Sequence
 - Count of Non-bases(if any)
 - Nucleotide Base-Count & its visualization
 - GC Content(%)
 - Melting Temperature(Tm)
 - Reverse Complement
 - Transcribed Sequence
 - Translated Sequence
