# NetDNA-1.0
This is my python script for a web-based tool - NetDNA-1.0. It can easily run on Streamlit and generates basic biological data from the query DNA sequence.

# Following details are obtained from the query DNA sequence:
- Length of the Sequence
- Count of Non-bases(if any)
- Nucleotide Base-Count & its visualization
- GC Content(%)
- Melting Temperature(Tm)
- Reverse Complement
- Transcribed Sequence
- Translated Sequence
